# FreeMoveVR VA

This project creates a Virtual Assistant (VA) for a personal project of mine, FreeMoveVR. 
FreeMoveVR is an interesting use case for VAs, as it's code is split across three repositories, 
each using their own languages and different formats. 


The project was created using Python 3.11.3 on Mac,
and uses Ollama to run LLMs locally and Chroma for vector storage.
